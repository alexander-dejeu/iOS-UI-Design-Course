 Inspired by https://github.com/itmeo/webgradients
 At time of creation there was only CSS3, .sketch and .PSD files.  I wondered why only web devs could reap
 benifits of this spectacular project!  I ported all of the color gradients over to Swift and added some of my
 own functions that I beilve will be useful for others as well.
